	<!--
        Levels will be split up into tiers
		Reaching a certain tier will unlock a new monster or two
		and will also increase the number of monsters on the field by 1 or 2 (depending on tier)

		Example
		<BlockMonsterLimit>
		    <Tier1>x</Tier1>
		    <Tier2>x</Tier2>
		    etc..
	    </BlockMonsterLimit>

		The Level class will still only have one variable for each monster limit
		But I'll store the different tiers in a map
		BlockMonster1 : Tier1Limit
		BlockMonster2 : Tier2Limit
        ..something like that. Will have to think about how to make the keys
		
		When a certain score is reached the tier will change and the new limits will be loaded from the map

		Should increase the challenge of the level, increase number of monsters on the field
        and add new monsters to the leve as the game goes on
